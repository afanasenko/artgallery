<p>Sergey Shcherbakov is a representative of realistic pictorial art. In his landscape paintings he is seeking for the mood in the first place. The genres artist works in are paysage, city paysage, still-life, and portrait. Works are performed in the techniques oil, watercolour, and printmaking. Plots of his landscapes are distinct and well-recognized. Any form of statics is definitely not in correspondence with artist’s character. Exact to the truth of life, the artist never decorates reality but each very common action is instinct with beauty for him. No ordinary situations exist for him. Everything that happens in life he takes worth artistic interpretation. The artist is in constant search for his plastic language. Sergey Prokofievich Shcherbakov was born in a large family on 20th of February, 1956 in Lopatino village, Penza district. In 1971 he enrolled in the oldest Russian art school, Penza Penza art school by name K. L. Savitsky, department of theatre decorations. In 1982 he arrives to Leningrad. The city has subdued him with the beauty of architectural ensembles and richness of museum collections. The artist works a lot in the town Siversky, Leningrad district. In 1984 he first visited Valaam Island together with the group of other artists. For many further years the impressions of Valaam become one of the plots of his paintings. Since 1994 he co-operates with the Mart-Art gallery in Kouvola, Finland. He travels a lot across Finland and creates new works dedicated to this beautiful northern land. Since 2004 he occasionally visits the White Sea region. Time and again the artist feels the call of tough and authentic beauty of this region, original characters of local people, warm welcome and expectation of new impressions. He depicts the beauty of vanishing world of White Sea villages in his paintings. His works have some discrete awareness, his own feeling of northern world. Since 2008 the artist actively participates in the exhibitions of “Karelia, myths and reality” project.</br>
